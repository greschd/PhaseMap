.. title:: Overview

.. container:: section
    
    is an algorithm for mapping phase diagrams. The key advantage of this algorithm is that the number of evaluations of the phase scales with the dimension of the phase boundary instead of the full phase space.
    
    This is the reference implementation for this algorithm.
